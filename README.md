# DT-Screening---Todo-List

This app is a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. It also includes a dark/light theme toggle.

Features:
Add new tasks
Delete tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Dark/Light mode toggle


Technologies Used
HTML(structure)
CSS(styling)
JavaScript(logic & functionality)


Explanation of how I handled the task:

The first thing i did is to set up the html structure of the app. I set up the header, footer, and the body of the app. I add the input tag where the users can type their todos. Then, I set up the div and ul element where the todos will show.

The second thing i do is to set up the JavaScript logic of the app. I use DOM to manipulate the html tags in the app like adding new todos with delete button, and marking todos with a strike-through line. It also includes the function on adding, deleting, and marking completed todos. I also used it on setting the current year fr the footer and the current date under My Todos header.


Last thing is to style the app using CSS. adding padding and margins, colors, styling the buttons, and adding animation on adding and removing todos. I also include the light and dark theme toggle.

I finish the logic of the application by less than an hour. Thinking about the logics on adding and removing todos and how to mark it when completed. Then I think about an hour again on styling the app. I am not good in styling so I spent much time in styling the app.
